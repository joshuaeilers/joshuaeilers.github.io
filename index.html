    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<!--
  - decide whether to do a blog-style app or a resume-style app
  - benefits of blog-style, is I can specifically showcase projects/solutions I want

  design ideas
  - scroll down page as content goes by (SPA that many companies are using)
  - just a really simple html/css blog
  - maybe a welcome/greeting overlay with an index to several projects?
  - click on a project/post and it expands/slides into an article where people can post things?
  - white background, photo of myself, a summary about me, links below with titles/dates (blog entries)
  - click on a blog entry, navigates to the blog page (uses hash-based url navigation)
  - commenting is a popover with a textarea, Post/cancel buttons
  - linked/github links/icons along the left or something
  - maybe an online resume listed on the same page or as a separate link?
    - probaby don't need this, instead I can have a section that demos UI widgets and other things like that
  - see if I can use CORS to call a Node service on heroku that can store the blogs/comments
  - or just host the entire thing on heroku

  blog content
  - see draft e-mail
  - Photos of the web apps I've worked on (no data included) - PhotoRosters / OUR Dashboard
  - talk about common problems I've solved (sqlBuilder in CF)
  - custom module system in JS
  - browserify and building a log tracking app
  - photo authorization by using base64 image encodings
