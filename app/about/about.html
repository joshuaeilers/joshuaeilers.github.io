  <h2 class="md-display-2">Hello</h2>
  <h6 class="md-title">
    I'm a programmer at UC Davis where I work on Graduate Studies software.
    Prior to that, I worked for Apple supporting Mac and OS X users while working on my Computer Science degree.
    My interests include OS theory, web application development, and building things that solve problems for people.
    I'm passionate about building simple, concise, and easy to use software that is maintainable and efficient.
